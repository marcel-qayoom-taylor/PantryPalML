                    📊 Supabase Database
                    (1,967 recipes + metadata)
```

### Data Sources
1. **User Interactions**: Recipe events (viewed, cooked, favourited) from analytics
2. **Recipe Database**: Complete PantryPal recipe catalog from Supabase
3. **Recipe Metadata**: Ingredients, tags, timing, authors, descriptions

### Feature Engineering
- **User Features (11)**: Engagement patterns, cooking frequency, preferences
- **Recipe Features (10)**: Complexity, ingredients, timing, categories
- **Interaction Features (3)**: Compatibility scores between user and recipe characteristics

## 🚀 Quick Start - Using the Model

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv add pandas numpy scikit-learn lightgbm supabase python-dotenv

# Set up Supabase credentials (required)
export SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### 2. Get Recipe Recommendations
```python
from recipe_recommender.inference.production_recipe_scorer import ProductionRecipeScorer

# Initialize the scorer (loads trained model automatically)
scorer = ProductionRecipeScorer()

# User's interaction history
user_interactions = [
    {"recipe_id": "100", "event_type": "Recipe Viewed", "timestamp": 1755665991},
    {"recipe_id": "100", "event_type": "Recipe Cooked", "timestamp": 1755666000},
    {"recipe_id": "1291", "event_type": "Recipe Favourited", "timestamp": 1755666100}
]

# Get personalized recommendations
recommendations = scorer.get_user_recipe_recommendations(
    user_id="user123",
    interaction_history=user_interactions,
    n_recommendations=10
)

# Use the recommendations
for rec in recommendations['recommendations']:
    print(f"{rec['recipe_name']} (Score: {rec['score']:.4f})")
    print(f"  Author: {rec['author_name']}")
    print(f"  Time: {rec['total_time']}min, Servings: {rec['servings']}")
```

### 3. Configuration Management
The system now uses centralized configuration for easy customization:

```python
from recipe_recommender.config import get_ml_config

# Get default configuration
config = get_ml_config()

# Customize training parameters
config.learning_rate = 0.05
config.num_leaves = 50
config.negative_sampling_ratio = 3

# Use custom config
from recipe_recommender.models.hybrid_gbm_recommender import HybridGBMRecommender
recommender = HybridGBMRecommender(config=config)
```

### 4. Integration Example (FastAPI)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from recipe_recommender.inference.production_recipe_scorer import ProductionRecipeScorer

app = FastAPI()
scorer = ProductionRecipeScorer()

@app.post("/recommendations")
async def get_recommendations(user_id: str, interactions: List[Dict]):
    return scorer.get_user_recipe_recommendations(
        user_id=user_id,
        interaction_history=interactions,
        n_recommendations=20
    )
```

## 📊 Model Performance

- **AUC**: 99.92% (near-perfect discrimination)
- **Precision**: 99.01% (very few false positives)  
- **Recall**: 96.14% (catches most relevant recipes)
- **F1-Score**: 97.55% (excellent overall performance)
- **NDCG@5**: 62.18% (good ranking quality)

**Training Data:**
- 20,730 user-recipe pairs (831 users × 4,117 recipes)
- 22 engineered features combining user behavior + recipe content
- Temporal train/validation/test split

## 🔄 Retraining with New Data

### When to Retrain
- **New user interactions**: Monthly or when interaction volume increases significantly
- **New recipes**: When new recipes are added to the database
- **Performance degradation**: If recommendation quality decreases

### Retraining Process

#### 1. Update Database
```bash
# Ensure new recipe data is in Supabase
# New user interactions should be in your event tracking
```

#### 2. Extract Fresh Data
```python
# Fetch updated recipe data from Supabase
from recipe_recommender.etl.database.fetch_real_recipes import RealRecipeDataFetcher
fetcher = RealRecipeDataFetcher(use_service_role=True)
dataset = fetcher.build_comprehensive_recipe_dataset()
```

#### 3. Rebuild Training Dataset
```python
# Rebuild training data with latest interactions + recipes
from recipe_recommender.models.hybrid_recommendation_data_builder import HybridRecommendationDataBuilder
builder = HybridRecommendationDataBuilder()
train_data, val_data, test_data = builder.prepare_training_data()
```

#### 4. Retrain Model
```python
# Train new model
from recipe_recommender.models.hybrid_gbm_recommender import HybridGBMRecommender
recommender = HybridGBMRecommender(model_type='lightgbm')
recommender.load_training_data()
recommender.load_recipe_features()
recommender.train_model()
recommender.save_model()
```

#### 5. Deploy Updated Model
```python
# The ProductionRecipeScorer will automatically load the new model
scorer = ProductionRecipeScorer()  # Loads latest trained model
```

### Complete Retraining Script
```bash
# Run the complete retraining pipeline
cd /path/to/PantryPalUtils

# 1. Fetch latest recipe data
uv run python recipe_recommender/etl/database/fetch_real_recipes.py

# 2. Rebuild training dataset  
uv run python recipe_recommender/models/hybrid_recommendation_data_builder.py

# 3. Train new model
uv run python recipe_recommender/models/hybrid_gbm_recommender.py

# 4. Test the updated model
uv run python recipe_recommender/inference/production_recipe_scorer.py
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No model found"**
- Make sure you've run the training pipeline: `hybrid_recommendation_data_builder.py` → `hybrid_gbm_recommender.py`

**"No recipe data"**  
- Verify Supabase connection: `python recipe_recommender/etl/database/supabase_config.py`
- Run data fetcher: `python recipe_recommender/etl/database/fetch_real_recipes.py`

**"Low recommendation quality"**
- Check if user has sufficient interaction history (minimum 3-5 interactions recommended)
- Verify training data quality and feature engineering
- Consider retraining with more recent data

**Performance issues**
- For very large recipe catalogs, consider adding recipe filtering by category/cuisine
- Cache user profiles for frequent requests
- Use batch scoring for multiple users

### Support
For technical issues:
1. Check the logs in each script for detailed error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed: `uv sync`
3. Ensure Supabase credentials are correctly set
4. Review the `real_database_summary.txt` for data quality issues
